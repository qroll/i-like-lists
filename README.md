This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This was meant as a simple playground for Next.js, but as always, it blew out of scope. For now, the home page is a simple search function to determine if an item can be recycled (in Singapore).

The app is hosted on Digital Ocean's new App Platform. [Access the site here](https://i-like-lists-w8kly.ondigitalocean.app/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Issues

Please let me know if I accidentally committed any secrets.
